# TensorflowMNIST
Analyzed CNN efficiency with image classification using Keras, Pandas, Numpy, etc. 
Data taken from Kaggle's fashion MNIST, a dataset of 10,000+ articles of clothing with the goal of classifying said images into their respective branch of clothing. 
Used a period of 50 epochs, any periods higher than this resulted in no significant difference to model accuracy.
Experimented with multiple Dropout layers to combat overfitting.
